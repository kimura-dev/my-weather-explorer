# WEATHER EXPLORER 

Link to live site: https://kimura-dev1297.github.io/my-weather-explorer/

I built this application using:

- HTML5 & CSS3
-Javascirpt
-jQuery

 Three API's used:

-IPSTACK API
-Openweather Map API
-Google Maps Javascirpt API 

Weather Explorer gives users the ability to search any location they desire, then simply click that location and have the its weather forcast provided.

I created this app so that users could have a fast and easy way to access weather forecasts for any area in the world. It's design makes it easy, fun and convenient to use. 

The home page offers instructions for the user on how to use the application. You use the map to search for areas and find there weather forecasts.

You canuse the search input bar to type in any address or location and an api call to global maps is made.

 Simultanelously a call goes to the openweathermaps API and then the locations weather data appears.
