# WEATHER EXPLORER 

Link to live site: https://kimura-dev1297.github.io/my-weather-explorer/

I built this application using:

- HTML5 & CSS3
-Javascirpt
-jQuery

 Three API's used:

-IPSTACK API for Geolocation
-Openweather Map API
-Google Maps Javascirpt API 

Weather Explorer is my attempt at working with as many useful API's as I can in one application. I used IPSTACK API for geolocation of the user to populate there current locations weather info.

You can use the search input bar to type in any address or location and an API call to global maps is made. Also you can use the google maps search features as well that come installed with the map to find locations manually.

 Simultanelously a call goes to the openweathermaps API and then the locations weather data appears.

And like magic the weather forcest is there. So three API calls later and there you have it, the Weather Explorer App.
